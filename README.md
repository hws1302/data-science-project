# data-science-project
A data science using project for part II physics.

Use data from CHARA telescope array [1] to find telescope positions relative to each other using least-squares regression via Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
Analysis over time to conclude whether significant movement has occured (e.g. due to plate tectonics).
