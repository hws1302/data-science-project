# data-science-project
A data science project for part II physics.

Use data from CHARA telescope array [1] to find telescope positions relative to each other using least-squares regression via Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
Analysis over time to conclude whether significant movement has occured (e.g. due to plate tectonics).

After exams this will be written up more cleanly and completely including a notebook walking through the essential steps:
- The problem 
- The data 
- The mathematical background 
- Writing functions 
- Some cool applications
